## 🔬 About the Game of Life

Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player game where each cell on a grid lives, dies, or reproduces based on a few simple rules:

- ✅ A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors **survives**.
- ❌ A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors **dies**.
- 🌱 A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors **becomes alive**.

These rules produce complex, often unexpected patterns and are a classical example of how simple systems can simulate life-like behavior.
