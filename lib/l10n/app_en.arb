    "whatIsCellularAutomatonContent": "Cellular automata are mathematical models consisting of a grid of cells, each in one of a limited number of states.\n Time in such systems is discrete – at each step, cells change their state based on fixed rules and the states of neighboring cells.\n Despite their simplicity, cellular automata can lead to highly complex behaviors. They are often used to study emergence – phenomena where complex system behavior arises from simple local rules.",

    "usageAndMeaningContent": "Cellular automata are used in many scientific fields, such as physics, biology, computer science, and chemistry.\n They serve to model natural phenomena, like the spread of fire, population growth, crystallization, or even information flow in networks.\n Studying them helps us understand how global patterns and complex systems can emerge from local rules. They are increasingly applied in artificial intelligence, urban simulations, and designing nature-inspired algorithms.",

    "conwaysGameOfLifeContent": "The most well-known example of a cellular automaton is the Game of Life, created by John Conway in 1970.\n It operates on a two-dimensional grid where each cell is either “alive” or “dead.” The rules determine the birth, survival, or death of a cell based on the number of its neighbors.\n Although the rules are simple, the game produces surprising patterns – from stable structures to objects that move or replicate.\n The Game of Life has inspired scientists and artists alike, demonstrating how order can emerge from apparent chaos.",
